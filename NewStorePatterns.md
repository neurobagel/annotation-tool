We want to move from the existing #data.ts store to new #FreshNewStore.ts . The goal of this transition is to no longer have unnecessary data in the store so the store logic can stay clean, readable, and maintainable.

To do so we've started implementing new types for #FreshNewStore.ts store in #datamodel.ts , normalized the state and structured it like a relational database table. The actions in store are the only way to update the state and tehse are essentially named after specific events that would trigger them. Any logic not relevant to store state but is part of an action e.g., reading a file is factored into a store utility function in #store-utils.ts and called inside the action. We've also made sure that only parent components (Upload, ColumnAnnotation, MultiColumnMeasures, ValueAnnotation, and Download) talk to the store through selectors and pass the data that child needs through props. If there is any logic that needs to happen to reshape a store state or variable we implement a hook for it to keep the logic in there like #useDisabledStandardizedVariables.ts and then call it in the parent.
